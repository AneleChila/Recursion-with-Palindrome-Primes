# Recursion with Palindrome Primes

Palindrome.py is a Python program that uses a recursive function to calculate whether or not a string is a palindrome (reads the same if reversed). 

Pairs.py is a Python program that uses a recursive function to count the number of pairs of repeated characters in a string.  Pairs of characters cannot overlap.

Encrypt.py is a Python program that uses a recursive function to encrypt a message by converting all lowercase characters to the next character (with z transformed to a). 

Palindromeprimes.py uses recursive functions to find all palindromic primes between two integers N, M, supplied as input. (start and end points are included). 
 A palindrome number is a number that reads the same from the front and the back. Examples are: 212, 44, 9009, 4567654.  
 To calculate whether a number is a palindrome or not, incorporate your answer to question 1. 
 A prime number is a number greater than 1 that is only divisible by 1 and itself.  Examples are: 3, 11, 313. 
Some examples of palindromic primes are: 11, 191, 313.
